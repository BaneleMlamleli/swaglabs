# swaglabs

This is Java Selenium Framework that automates [swaglabs](https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/index.html), a small e-commerce website. My aim is to try and create a robust, maintainable, and scalable Selenium framework that implements real world project concepts, standards and technologies

## Tech-stack for the project

- ![AWS EC2](./src/main/java/com/saucedemo/icons/social.png) AWS EC2
  - Successfully setup and ran Jenkins on AWS EC2 Linux Ubuntu Micro Instance
  - Due to not wanting to risk forgetting to stop the instance, even though I'm running a free tier, and also not fully understanding the security group's security I've decided to terminate the instance and rather play it safe. I don't want to sell my house in order to pay for an AWS EC2 instance :-)

## Project Structure

I implemented the page object model design pattern, where all the tests are separated in their own pages

- Java - Contains all the different packages required for the framework
- extentReports - This package contains classes to create and customize the extent extentReports
- pagesObjects - This package contains classes for different pages in a project
- tests - this package contains all the tests classes
- utils - this package contains all the re-usable classes
- resources - this package will contain files such as config files, data files, etc

## Reporting

- The reports will be saved under the folder 'reports'
- To open the report - you have to launch it with a browser of your choice. Options will be available on the report

## Execution

There are three ways one can run this project

- You can run it directly at a test class level not individual methods, by clicking the play button
- Run from testng.xml with the command **mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml**
- Run using maven command **mvn test**
